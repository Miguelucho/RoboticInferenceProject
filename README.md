# RoboticInferenceProject
The project presented in this repository focuses on the recognition of objects using a video camera that transmits live. For the recognition of objects, two neural networks with different samples were trained. 
Then with the video camera transmitting live, the neural network uses the images captured as input and infers as output a label for the object captured in the image also generate a type of electronic action, such as turning on a led.

The important thing about this repository is the IEEE PDF document where all the procedures are explained so that the reader can reproduce them and make their own inference.

The other files and folders in this repository are the files and folders commented on in the document and are in the repository so that the reader can access them if necessary.

Errata:
In the file .gitignore is the path of a file that is ignored when uploading this repository.
That file is very important. It is the neural network model of the toy animals to be able to recognize them. The reason for ignoring the file is that it weighs 227.5 Mb and GitHub does not allow me to upload a file that weighs more than 100 Mb.
If you wish to reproduce the project, please contact me with a request for the file. Thanks.
